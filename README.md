# Python Coding Challenges

A collection of Python coding challenges with test-driven development.

## Project Structure

Each challenge is organized in its own directory with the following structure:

- `solution.py`: Write your solution here
- `test_*.py`: Contains challenge description and tests

## Running Challenges

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run a specific challenge:
   ```bash
   python run_challenge.py easy/sum
   ```

## Adding New Challenges

1. Create a new directory under the appropriate difficulty level
2. Add `solution.py` with the function stub
3. Add `test_*.py` with challenge description and tests
